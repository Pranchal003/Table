# HTML Table Project

## 📌 Description

This is a simple HTML page that displays an **Employee Table**.  
The table shows some employee details like **Name, Interest Area, and Age**.  
It also calculates the **average age** and displays it at the bottom of the table.

## ⚙️ **What I Have Used**

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`** — Defines the document type as HTML5.
- **`<html lang="en">`** — Sets the language of the page to English.
- **`<head>` Section:**
  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">` — Sets the character encoding.
  - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` — Makes the page responsive.
  - `<title>` — Sets the page title to **TABLE**.
  - `<style>` — Contains CSS for styling the table.

## 🎨 **CSS Styling**

- **`table { border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; }`**
  - Makes the table borders collapse into single lines and sets width to full page.

- **`td, th`**
  - Adds padding and aligns text to the left.

- **`tr:nth-child(even)`**
  - Gives alternate row colors for better readability.
  - Note: There are two `nth-child(even)` rules; only the last one (`#D6EEEE`) will be used.

## 📋 **Table Content**

  - Has rows `<tr>`, headers `<th>`, and data cells `<td>`.
